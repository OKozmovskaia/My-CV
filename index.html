      <h1>about me</h1>
      <div id="short-intro">34 years / Brussels / Student</div>
      <p>Three years ago I went to Belgium. After sometime, I started to understand that the adaptation without a job will never be complete. I need a job that will put a structure into my new life.<br>
        I have a degree in a social psychology. But psychology is very language dependent - my language skills must be close to ones of a native speaker. <br>
        Considering my age (I’m 34 years old), an IT profession is the most accessible field for me to start a new career in.
        Because in the IT field, formal education is not so important and the requirements for the language are less strict. Knowledge and skills are far more important, and if I will persevere and determined, I will be able succeed.</p>
